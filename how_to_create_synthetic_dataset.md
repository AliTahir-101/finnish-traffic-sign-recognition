# üìñ How to Create a Synthetic Dataset for Model Training from SVG Files

This guide walks you through the process of creating a synthetic dataset using **Blender** and Python scripts. By following these steps, you‚Äôll generate a transparent background dataset with various angles from SVG files, and then augment it with realistic backgrounds for model training.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

1. **Blender 4.x**: Download and install the latest version of Blender from [Blender Official Website](https://www.blender.org/download/).
2. **Python Environment**: Make sure you have Python installed and set up for running scripts.
3. **Scripts Provided**:
   - `blender_script.py`: Automates SVG processing in Blender.
   - `create_dataset_from_transparent_blender_images.py`: Generates a synthetic dataset by combining transparent images with real-world backgrounds.

## üöÄ Steps to Create the Dataset

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Generate Transparent Background Dataset with Blender**

1. **Install and Open Blender**:
   - Download and install the latest version of **Blender 4.x**.
   - Open Blender and select **File > New > General**.
   - Save the new Blender project file.

2. **Navigate to the Scripting Tab**:
   - From the **top bar** of Blender, go to the **right** and select the **Scripting** tab.

3. **Load and Run the Script**:
   - Open the provided `blender_script.py` in the scripting tab.
   - Set the **input path** for your SVG files and the **output path** for the generated images in the script:
     ```python
     svg_files_dir = r'path_to_svg_files'  # Set your SVG input folder
     output_dir = r'path_to_output_folder'  # Set your desired output folder
     ```
   - Run the script by pressing the **Play button** or `Alt + P`.
   - Wait for the script to process all SVG files. It will generate a dataset of svgs with **transparent backgrounds** and various angles.

4. **Save and Close Blender**:
   - Once the script finishes processing, save your work and close Blender. The transparent background dataset is now ready.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Create the Synthetic Dataset with Realistic Backgrounds**

1. **Set Up the Background Augmentation Script**:
   - Open the provided `create_dataset_from_transparent_blender_images.py` in your favorite editor (e.g., VS Code).

2. **Configure Paths**:
   - Edit the paths in the script to match your directory structure:
     ```python
     background_dir = r'C:\Users\ali\workspace\backgrounds'
     base_dir = r'C:\Users\ali\workspace\transparent_dataset'
     output_dir = r'D:\dataset\drive_With_more_than_500GB_available'
     ```
   - `background_dir`: Path to the folder containing real-world background images.
   - `base_dir`: Path to the folder containing transparent images generated by Blender.
   - `output_dir`: Path to save the final synthetic dataset.

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script to combine transparent images with various backgrounds.
   - The script will create the final **augmented dataset** in the specified `output_dir`.

## üéâ Boom! Your Dataset is Ready

After completing the above steps:
- You will have a synthetic dataset with traffic signs overlaid on realistic backgrounds, ready for training your machine learning models.

## ‚ú® Notes and Tips

1. **SVG File Source**:
   - Make sure your SVG files are clean and compatible with Blender.
   - For traffic signs, you can use resources like [Finnish Traffic Agency](https://github.com/finnishtransportagency/liikennemerkit).

2. **Backgrounds**:
   - Use high-resolution background images that mimic real-world scenarios for better augmentation results.
   - Avoid using repetitive backgrounds to ensure diverse training data.

3. **Experiment**:
   - Tweak the scripts to introduce more variations, such as:
     - Lighting conditions (e.g., day, night, cloudy).
     - Motion blur to simulate movement.
     - Different rotations or zoom levels.
   - Try different output resolutions to match your model's input requirements.

4. **File Organization**:
   - Keep your folders organized to make it easier to manage input files, scripts, and outputs.

5. **Performance**:
   - Blender can be resource-intensive. Run it on a machine with sufficient memory and processing power.
   - For large datasets, consider batching the SVG files to process them in smaller chunks.

6. **Dataset Validation**:
   - Before training, inspect a few samples from your generated dataset to ensure the quality of the augmentations.
   - Remove any incorrectly augmented or low-quality images.

7. **Script Customization**:
   - Both the Blender and Python scripts are customizable. Add functionality as needed to suit your dataset requirements.
