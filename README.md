# üö¶ Finnish Traffic Sign Recognition with Synthetic Data üöò

Welcome to the repository for **"Enhancing Real-World Finnish Traffic Sign Detection and Classification Using Synthetic Data Augmentation and Transfer Learning Techniques"**. This project is part of my Master‚Äôs thesis in Artificial Intelligence at JAMK University of Applied Sciences.

## üìñ About the Project

This project explores the use of synthetic data, transfer learning, and advanced models to improve the detection and classification of Finnish traffic signs. The work focuses on:
- Generating synthetic datasets with 38 and 55 traffic sign classes using Blender and OpenCV.
- Training state-of-the-art classifiers like `EfficientNetB0` for improved accuracy.
- Developing a real-time detection pipeline using `YOLOv11`.
- Comparing `YOLOv11` with a hybrid approach: `YOLOv11 + EfficientNetB0`.

## üìä Datasets

### 1. üñºÔ∏è Cropped Traffic Sign Dataset
- [**38 Classes**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YFE1j81nrWktzH0hisaKpJc9ig6UOZqT/view?usp=sharing): A synthetic dataset of cropped traffic sign images representing 38 Finnish traffic signs.
- [**55 Classes**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yc9oF-qecFO9CkpS3YrlC7WyCq4XU8Ml/view?usp=sharing): An extended dataset including additional traffic sign types for a total of 55 classes.
- [**55 Classes with Transparent Backgrounds**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EgoCKEISKd-_xttAX4wILchWsajzQeMz/view?usp=sharing): A synthetic dataset with transparent backgrounds to facilitate further research and synthetic data creation. These images can be directly used for data augmentation or inserted into real-world scenes using tools like OpenCV or Blender.
### 2. üìè YOLO Dataset
- Images with bounding boxes for real-time traffic sign detection.

## üîÑ How to Create a Synthetic Dataset

If you're interested in creating a synthetic dataset from SVG files, I‚Äôve provided a guide in a separate documentation file. This guide covers the process of generating a transparent background dataset using Blender and augmenting it with realistic backgrounds for machine learning model training.

üëâ **[Read the full guide here](./how_to_create_synthetic_dataset.md)**

This guide includes:
- Setting up Blender and running the provided Python script for SVG processing.
- Using a Python script to create a final augmented dataset with real-world backgrounds.
- Tips and notes to customize the scripts and optimize your dataset creation process.

## üñºÔ∏è Dataset Visualization

Below is a collage of the **55 Finnish Traffic Sign Classes** used to create the dataset and train the models. These include the original 38 classes and the newly added 17 classes for a total of 55:

### üîó Original SVG Files

The original SVG files for Finnish traffic signs were sourced from the [Finnish Traffic Agency GitHub Repository](https://github.com/finnishtransportagency/liikennemerkit/tree/master/collections/new_signs/svg). These files were processed using **Blender** and **OpenCV** to generate synthetic datasets with realistic augmentations, including lighting, motion blur, and various environmental conditions.

## üñºÔ∏è Classification Results Sample

Below is a sample collage of classification results for the **55-class model** on real-world data:

![Classification Results Collage](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa89ec23-1adc-4db2-834c-85e483baf27a)


These samples demonstrate the model's ability to accurately classify Finnish traffic signs under various environmental conditions, including different lighting, perspectives, and occlusions.

| **Room for Growth**            | ---                                       | - EfficientNetB0 could be improved with images of varying resolutions to better handle small and large signs. Current training on 100x100 images limits generalization to different sizes. | - EfficientNetB0 performance could be enhanced by introducing more diverse augmentations and additional variations in real-world scenarios. | - YOLOv11 could be trained further to improve generalization. Expanding training datasets with more diversity and fine-tuning hyperparameters could yield better results. Resource and time constraints limited these optimizations. |
